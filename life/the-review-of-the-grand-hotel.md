# The review of The Grand Hotel

Recently, I cultivate a habit of writing book review, hoping that will improve my expression ability gradually.

What does grand hotel look like? Resplendent outfit, intimate service or comfortable enviroment…… Maybe such a hotel fits the image of a grand hotel in people's minds, it can meet accommodation needs perfectly. But, dose it make tenant feel at home? I don't know. The above conditinos should be necessary but not sufficient conditions, in my opinion, more detailed humanistic care is an important influencing factor which make tenant feel at home.

_The Grand Hotel_ told what happened in five days at the hotel, including the relationship between management and ordinary employees, outer covetous capitalist, thief, sins of the powerful and so on. Among all these scenes, a paragraph describing the hotel structure makes me unforgetful, because it show me that the hotel itself is a huge organization that requires the cooperation of every part to make it work!

The hotel needs all kinds of employees to make sure everything is ok. Such as chef who provding meals, waiter who providing wake-up calls, engineers who make sure the equipment work properly, manager who deal with tricky or unexpected things……

Of course, this book not only describe the hotel, but also emphasizes the relationship between people, especially **love**. I have no surprise about the love between young talent and clever beauty, instead the love between super capital O'Keefe and his female companion Dorothy in this book make me shocked. As for O'Keefe, no matter how many female companion he want, he will get without effort. So when he ditched Dorothy, he should feel peacefully in normal. Nonetheless, O'Keefe rushed towards Dorothy like crazy when he saw her lying in hotel lobby in blood due to a malfunctioning elevator. When they arrived at hospital, he humbly asked the doctor to save Dorothy. Later, O'Keefe ordered his subordinates in a rage to drop everything and chater a plane, just to get Dorothy's mother to New Orleans as soon as possible.

Although it's been two hours since I finished this book, I'm still impressed by the love.
