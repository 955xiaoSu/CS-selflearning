# A passion for difficultand novel problems

**Thanks for Professor Xiao**

Until today, I know why I come for HNU while not stay at home. Because there have someone who guide me the way to the difficulty. That must be hard but fun!!!

I come here for solving problems, challenging limits. That's the goal I will devoted all of myself to finish, and there are so many charming problems in the world of computer science, that's enough!

OS, Computer Networking, CSAPP in this semester, let's go!!!

**"Education is not filling the bucker of water but lighting a fire!"** And then we have the power to make great achievements.
